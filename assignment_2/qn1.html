    <p>
        I was born and raised In Addis Abeba, Ethiopia. I graduated
        with a bachelor of science in information system from Hawaassa
        University. I moved to us and settled in Boston, MA. Living in
        us provided me with the opportunity to grow and develop both in
        my personal and professional life.

        As a child growing up in Addis Abeba with a big family and strong
        church community has taught me a lot, I have learned how to love,
        how to be loved and most of all how to respect people for who they
        are. The church community has professed a strong ethical philosophy that has remained with me throughout my
        life, and thatâ€™s why I still have a good social life. In 2011 I graduated high school from magic carpet my
        teachers and my class mate made my high school experience wonderful and unforgettable. In 2015 I graduated from
        Hawassa University and started my first job as a junior java developer in vision Tec Company it was a good
        learning experience to work there and made a lot of good friends.
